### 2.0.0 - February 12 2023
- Completely rewrote the bot using TypeScript and [discordx](https://discordx.js.org/)
- Updated to discord.js v14
- Now using the [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) ORM
- Now using environmental variables to store credentials
- Replaced all regular commands with Slash commands
- WatchLyst now requires less permissions to function (Send Messages and Ban Members)
- Listed users will be displayed with their username and ID instead of just ID
- WatchLyst now handles Snowflake IDs through the Discord API instead of as strings. Non-existent IDs will be rejected

- Increased the maximum amount of characters for a listed user's reason from 512 to 999
- Added `/update [User ID*] [New description]` as a way to update existing users
- A message will be sent when a listed user leaves the server. That will not remove the listed user from the server's WatchLyst
- When a listed user is banned from the server, they will be automatically unlisted
- When an assigned role or channel are deleted in a server, WatchLyst will automatically remove them from the server's configuration and notify the server's owner
- A server's WatchLyst information will automatically be destroyed when WatchLyst is removed from the server (but not its listed users)

- Fixed an issue where IDs not 18 characters in length would not be registered
